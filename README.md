NES emulador for MS-DOS

This is an old source-code for a NES emulator that I developed during my
undergraduate years. You will need a MS-DOS environment (such as DOS-BOX) to
compile and execute it (I am already making the standalone executable file available).

As far as I remember, there is no sound emulation. Also, not all memory
mappers are supported. I will be very delighted to hear of any improvements
you might make to the code.
